I created this document to keep track of my savings (I have changed the actual numbers, as not to expose any personal information). The default configuration may not be applicable to your situation, without some changes. Be careful what you read online about stocks and investments, much of that information is absolute garbage.

Remember to scale the results based on expected changes in CPI data over the given time window (i.e. future inflation).

NOTE: At time of writing, I have both domestic and international equities configured at a 7% expected return. In reality, it is very possible that foreign markets may outperform North American markets for a long period, given current lofty domestic valuations. But impossible to predict the future.
